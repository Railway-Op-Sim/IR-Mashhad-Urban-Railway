# Mashhad Urban Railway

The Mashhad Urban Railway is a network of two metro lines connecting the suburbs of the city of Mashhad in Razavi Khorasan province, Iran. Currently the system contains two lines Line 1 and Line 2 with plans for further extensions, and two additional lines under development.

* Line 1 is 14.5 km in length and connects the west of the city with the airport to the east.
* Line 2 began full operation in 2019, it connects the suburbs of Tabarsi in the north with Shahid Kaveh in the south.

## Simulation

The simulation is semi-fictional as data sources are limited outside of Iran itself. The route contains all network stations, however speed limits and rolling stock specificaitons have been approximated in order to match the timetable for Line 1.

The timetable itself is also semi-fictional as the information is only readily available within Iran. The author only had access to the eastbound timetable for Line 1.

Rolling stock movements in and out of the three main depots are also estimated based on the timetable.

### Tips

* Although the simulation will frequently throw alerts due to held services these can be ignored as the services are often not yet due until the next calling point. Keep an eye on the service information to prioritise.
* At the start of the simulation, empty rolling stock will frequently leave Vakil Abad and Ghadir depots, these can be held at the main line entrance shunting signals whilst awaiting an empty platform.
* Keep an eye on services at Sahid Kaveh and Hasheminejad Airport, the turn around times can be quit tight.
* Services returning to Vakil Abad should use the loop to enter the platform from the west.

## Development

This simulation is semi-fictional, however I would love to make it realistic! If you have any additional information or would like to contribute to the project, please either make a merge request or open an issue.
