# Mashhad Urban Railway
A simulation of the Mashhad Urban Railway the metro system for the city of Mashhad, the capital of Iran's Razavi Khorasan Province.
This simulation is semi-fictional, although the route is accurate, exact speed limits are unknown and the timetables are only accessible within Iran itself, I managed to get access to a single direction timetable for Line 1.
